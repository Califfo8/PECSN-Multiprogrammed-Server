\section{Objectives}
A multi-programmed server provides service to \textbf{N concurrent clients} that request the server to perform transactions. \textbf{Local CPU} computations, interactions with the \textbf{local disk}, and remote queries to a \textbf{distant web server} are all processes that may be involved in transactions. 
An interaction between clients and server can be defined as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A new transaction always requires some processing time as a first step;
    \item Transactions can follow different flows based on probability. 
    \item A reply is sent to the client that originated the request.
    \item A user that receives a reply immediately issues another request.
\end{enumerate}

Utilizing the FIFO policy, each module within the system (Local CPU, local disk and the remote web server) is capable of processing a single request at any given time.
Considering the previous assumptions, it becomes crucial to evaluate the system's performance with a particular emphasis on throughput and ....... . 
With the aid of the Omnet++ simulation software, we can gain insights into the systemâ€™s behavior under various conditions. Furthermore, utilizing MS Excel, we can collect the data obtained from simulations for data analysis and graph representations.
